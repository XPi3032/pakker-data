Welcome to my website!

I'm ChunkyMilk0309 as you may or may not already know and I enjoy building and tinkering with electronics including both hardware and software.

I use Raspberry Pi quite frequently and often and that's what I mainly tiker with. As of August 31 2020 I have 1 Raspberry Pi 4B 4gigs of ram, 2 Zero W, and a couple 3s.

This is the website and domain I'll post on my blog, program, and other stuff. If you'd like to contact me you can do so at pinetcontrolcenter@gmail.com.

Also, soon you'll be able to see live updates on my Raspberry Pi stack! I will soon be incorporating a web interface into all my Pi and they will be accessible via one page.

Thanks for checking this page out! You can see my latest updates on what I've been doing at updates.pinetmedia.com . Have a nice day.
